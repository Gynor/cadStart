# cadStart
## Details 

In this project main purpose is developing a basic cad application.

For now I planned to create equation based shapes and shapes memory.

Any kind of help really appreciated.

Some points:

-Drawing separate from formulas

-Formulas of the shapes are containing in the XML file

-Intersections gonna split the formulas 

-Cut or Delete a *selected?* shape gonna delete formula of the shape. Existing shapes gonna redraw on the screen. 

-I am not sure about adding keyboard shortcuts

-Updated soon
